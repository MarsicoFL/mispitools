## Installation

The goal of mispitools is to bring a simulation framework for decision
making in missing person identification cases. You can install the
released version of mispitools from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org)
with:

## Example

This is an example based on a grandchild identification, first you
should do the simulations:

    ## Registered S3 method overwritten by 'quantmod':
    ##   method            from
    ##   as.zoo.data.frame zoo

    ## Loading required package: pedtools

Once obtained, false postive (FPR) and false negative rates (FNR) could
be computed. This allows to calculate Matthews correlation coefficient
for a specific LR threshold (T):

    ## [1] "FNR = 0.876 ;  FPR = 0.006 ;  MCC = 0.239325804722877"

Likelihoold ratio distributions under both hypothesis, relatedness and
unrelatedness could be plotted.

Decision plot brings the posibility of analyzing FPR and FNR for each LR
threshold.

Decision threshold could be calculated. For further reading please see
