## Installation

The goal of mispitools is to bring a simulation framework for decision
making in missing person identification cases. You can install the
released version of mispitools from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org)
with:

    ## Registered S3 method overwritten by 'quantmod':
    ##   method            from
    ##   as.zoo.data.frame zoo

    ## Loading required package: pedtools

## Example

This is an example based on a grandchild identification, first you
should do the simulations:

``` r
library(mispitools)
library(forrel)
x = linearPed(2)
x = setMarkers(x, locusAttributes = NorwegianFrequencies[1:5])
x = profileSim(x, N = 1, ids = 2)[[1]]
datasim = makeLRsims(x, missing = 5, 1000, 123)
```

Once obtained, false postive (FPR) and false negative rates (FNR) could
be computed. This allows to calculate Matthews correlation coefficient
for a specific LR threshold (T):

``` r
Trates(datasim, 10)
```

    ## [1] "FNR = 0.581 ;  FPR = 0.007 ;  MCC = 0.503141398386643"

Likelihoold ratio distributions under both hypothesis, relatedness and
unrelatedness could be plotted.

``` r
LRdist(datasim)
```

Decision plot brings the posibility of analyzing FPR and FNR for each LR
threshold.

``` r
deplot(datasim)
```

![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/deplot-1.png)

Decision threshold could be calculated. For further reading please see
DOI: 10.1016/j.fsigen.2021.102519

``` r
DTsim(datasim, 10)
```
