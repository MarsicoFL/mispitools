\arguments{
\item{datasim}{Input dataframe containing expected LRs for related and unrelated POIs. It should be the output from makeLRsims function.}

\item{type}{Select between a density plot (type = 1, default) or a violin plot (type = 2).}
}
\value{
A plot showing likelihood ratio distributions under relatedness and unrelatedness hypothesis.
