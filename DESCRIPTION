Description: An open source software package written in R statistical language. It consists of a set of decision-making tools to conduct missing person searches.  Particularly, it allows computing optimal LR threshold for declaring potential matches in DNA-based database search. More recently 'mispitools' incorporates preliminary investigation data based LRs. Statistical weight of different traces of evidence such as biological sex, age and hair color are presented.
