## The Entangled Concepts of Race, Ancestry, and Ethnicity: Implications for AI in Genetic Testing
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into genetic testing, particularly in fields such as forensic genetics, is complicated by the pervasive and often overlapping concepts of race, ancestry, and ethnicity. While ancestry is a genetic concept, reflecting whose DNA an individual carries, race and ethnicity are fundamentally social constructs. The way these social concepts are understood profoundly influences how genetic ancestry is interpreted, leading to biases in both data and application. The modern approach to biogeographical ancestry (BGA) estimation, for example, operates under two critical, and often flawed, assumptions: the results produced by algorithms will be an accurate representation of people's identities and the public will have the scientific literacy to arrive at accurate conclusions from the outputs of the algorithm (Michael et al., p. 44).

Oftentimes, these assumptions do not hold true. The public often takes genetic testing results as a direct reflection of their identity, a tendency fueled by a sociogenetic essentialist bias that equates genetic ancestry with personal history and identity. This might lead people to use ancestry test results as confirmation of the genetic basis of social groups (Kampourakis and Fux, 2025, p. 1). Furthermore, these testing methods risk reducing identity to a single dimension, ignoring the complex, entangled formation of identity with concepts of history, culture, religion, language, memory, and other non-biological categories of belonging.

This single-dimensionality is a significant hurdle, particularly in forensic genetics. Similarly, forensic genetics efforts are in need of a social/anthropological lens to inform investigations and avoid this single-dimensional approach. Hence, a more equitable machine learning algorithm would be the one that incorporates complex dimensions of belonging. The very BGA estimation algorithms employed are "socially constructed, rooted in racialised notions of biogeography, and become racialised in the process of interpretation and dissemination" (Michael et al., p. 45). The foundation of these biases lies in the initial categorization and sampling methods used to create datasets. The impact of these choices is profound. For instance, Schwartz-Marin et al. (2025) argue, "rather than dividing populations by continental groupings (which of course comes from a certain colonial epistemology), if we had divided populations by class or say caste, we would have arrived at a completely different genetic grouping of human populations. And if we continued to use that overarching framework to interrogate contemporary populations, we would have seen consistent genetic differences between different class and caste groups, to infer some kind of biological reality" (p. 5). This illustrates how the initial framing, often rooted in colonial concepts of race, dictates the genetic groupings produced.

Race, as a colonial concept, introduced misconceptions that continue to plague modern genetic interpretation. Decolonization, therefore, requires a social science perspective on forensic genetics. Social anthropologists, for instance, contribute by exploring "how practitioners and the public do with genomic data, and how this relates to issues of identity" (Michael et.al., 2021, p.42). The myth of race as a biological concept, a tool for establishing superiority, must be dismantled. Alleged racial traits are genetically independent of each other and bear no relation to how humans are socially classified. Instead, community definition depends not on "racial traits" or genetic markers, but on how an individual characterizes themselves and defines themselves within their social circles. The distinction between "*etic* (forensic anthropological ancestry analysis)" and "*emic* (individually-constructed identity)" (Digangi and Bethard, 2021, p.426) is crucial here. Basing forensic identification efforts on these interknotted concepts would obscure the efforts, and creating algorithms based on this confusion would exaggerate the obscuration. 

**Implications for AI Implementation in mispitools: From Calculation to Automated Inference**

The potential integration of AI agents into *mispitools* presents a critical juncture where the statistical rigor of forensic genetics collides with the entangled concepts of race and identity. Currently, *mispitools* functions as a decision-support tool, requiring users to explicitly define parameters for "non-genetic data-based likelihood ratios (LRs)" such as "pigmentation traits" and "hair color". However, there is no strict framework in the industry for defining these parameters. If an AI agent is tasked with optimizing these LRs to find a "match," it risks treating these phenotypic inputs as objective biological truths rather than socially contextualized descriptors. An AI driven purely by efficiency may exploit "sociogenetic essentialist bias" as a cognitive shortcut to categorize ambiguous phenotypic data into rigid, racialized categories, automating the colonial epistemology that divides populations by broad, often inaccurate groupings rather than granular realities, such as class or community.

Furthermore, *mispitools* relies on reference data, such as the "allele frequency database from Argentina" and assumed "population reference age distributions." As Schwartz-Marin et al. (2025) also argue, such data structures often carry inherent biases. For instance, grouping populations by nation-state or continent often obscures genetic differences driven by social stratification (e.g., caste or class). An AI agent trained on these unexamined frequency tables would unknowingly propagate these biases. 

**Steps for Ethical AI Integration in *mispitools***
To mitigate these risks, the implementation of AI agents in *mispitools* must follow a "decolonizing" framework that prioritizes social context over pure computational efficiency.

- **Step 1: Decolonize the Reference Data Before Automation**. Before training any AI agent to interpret LRs from *mispitools*, the underlying data must be audited. As suggested by Schwartz-Marin et al., developers must ensure that data groupings do not rely solely on "continental groupings" rooted in colonial history. The AI should be trained on datasets that reflect "complex dimensions of belonging" rather than simplified racial proxies.
    
- **Step 2: Differentiate Phenotype from Identity**. The AI architecture must explicitly distinguish between calculating a statistical probability based on a physical trait and assigning an identity. The system should be programmed to flag "etic" classifications as preliminary and statistically bounded, preventing the "sociogenetic essentialist bias" where users misinterpret a high LR as a confirmation of social racial identity.
    
- **Step 3: Keep the "Human-in-the-Loop" for Decision Thresholds**. While *mispitools* can mathematically compute an optimal LR threshold, an AI should not be empowered to make final exclusionary decisions based solely on these thresholds. Given that social race designations are influenced by a complex interplay between phenotype, ethnicity, language dialect, and religion, determining a match requires an interdisciplinary approach. The AI should function as a transparent calculator of probabilities, leaving the qualitative assessment of identity to human experts who can apply the necessary social/anthropological lens.
